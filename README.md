# 🎄 Festive Logic: Christmas Calculator
**Role: UI Design | Front-End**
> A sophisticated, holiday-themed calculator built with a "Design-First" approach. This project demonstrates the bridge between high-fidelity UI/UX design in Figma and responsive web implementation. 

## 🚀 Project Status 
This project is currently in its **UI/UX implementation phase**.<br>
The calculator interface is fully designed and built using HTML and CSS, faithfully translating a high-fidelity Figma mockup into a responsive web layout. 

JavaScript functionality (calculator logic and interactions) is **planned and in progress** and will be added in a future iteration.

## 🧱 Design Philosophy 
This project emphasizes the transition from visual design to code, focusing on layout fidelity, visual depth, and scalable styling before introducing application logic. 

The core challenge was to create a festive all-ages interface that felt magical for children yet professional and "neutral" for adults. By moving away from literal clipart and focusing on **Micro-Texture** and **Atmospheric Cues**, the UI achieves a premium, jewel-toned aesthetic. 

### 🖌️ Key Design Elements: 
- **Emerald & Gold Operators**: Functional buttons featuring custom "Micro-Texured" sparkles and gold-leaf borders. 
- **Frosted Ice Numbers**: A cool, high-contrast palette with subtle snowflake watermarks to improve readability. 
- **Polished Silver Utility**: A neutral row of chrome-styled buttons with etched holly patterns to balance the vibrant colors. 
- **The Bleeding Technique**: Icons are strategically clipped by button frames to create a dynamic, background-pattern feel rather than a static sticker look. 

## 🖥️ Technical Stack
- **Design**: Figma (Gradients, Inner Shadows, Auto Layout, and Layer Blurring).
- **Front-end**: 
  - HTML and CSS (current implementation)
  - JavaScript (planned for calculator logic and interactivity) 

## ✨ Features (Current)
- **Design-First Implementation**: Pixel-accurate translation from Figma to code. 
- **Sophisticated Shimmer Effects**: Layered gradients, opacity shifts, and blur to simulate physical materials. 
- **Responsive Grid**: Structured using modern CSS techniques for consistent alignment. 
- **Visual Hierarchy & Accessibility**: High-contrast number keys and distinct operator styling for intuitive use. 

## 🔜 Planned Enhancements
- JavaScript-powered calculator logic (standard arithmetic operations). 
- Button interaction states (press, hover, active). 
- Keyboard input support. 
- Subtle animated feedback for operations and errors.
